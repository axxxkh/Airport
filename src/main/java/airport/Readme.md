# AIRPORT

This is my pet project on JAVA with Hibernate implementing DAO and Repository patterns which simulates working of
Airport.

## Database model

Database model divided in four layers: Passenger (include tables Passenger, Passport and Ticket), Flight (tables Flight
and Route), Facility (tables terminal and gate), Airline (tables airline, aircraft, aircraft_types).
